### NOTABLE CHANGES

Helidon MCP 1.0.0 introduces major improvement on `2025-03-26` MCP specification support:

- Security
- Cancellation feature
- Resource subscription/unsubscription

### BREAKING CHANGES

Helidon MCP 1.0.0 release brings two backward incompatible changes.

- Prompt arguments returns a `List` instead of a `Set`.

Due to issue with argument ordering using a `Set`, it now uses a `List` and stay consistent.

- JSON Schema annotation `@Mcp.JsonSchema` is replaced by `@JsonSchema.Schema`.

Helidon MCP now leverages Helidon JSON Schema introduced in `4.3.0` release. POJOs used as tool inputs do not need
to provide their JSON Schema as string. Helidon will generate it for you!
